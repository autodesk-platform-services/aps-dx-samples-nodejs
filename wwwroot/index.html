            <h5>Get exchange item information Sample Workflow</h5>
            Before exploring the exchanged data, it is required to get the exchange id, which can be retrieved
            from the exchange item located in ACC. <br/>
            This workflow focuses on the part of the Data Exchange GraphQL API, needed to navigate through hubs, projects,
            folders and identifying the exchange item.<br /><br/>

            <h5>Window Schedule Sample Workflow</h5>
            A schedule is typically used to identify, in most cases a chart or table providing descriptions of the
            windows , doors, finishes, lintels, footings, piers, etc. on a construction project. Let's take the same
            sample model and imagine that you would like to build a window schedule. You will need to retrieve
            properties like panel glazing, glass, frame material, height, width, etc. of all design entity instances of
            category windows.<br />
