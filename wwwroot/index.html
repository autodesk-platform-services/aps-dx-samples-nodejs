            <h5>Window Schedule Sample Workflow</h5>
            A schedule is typically used to identify, in most cases a chart or table providing descriptions of the
            windows , doors, finishes, lintels, footings, piers, etc. on a construction project. Let's take the same
            sample model and imagine that you would like to build a window schedule. You will need to retrieve
            properties like panel glazing, glass, frame material, height, width, etc. of all design entity instances of
            category windows.<br />
